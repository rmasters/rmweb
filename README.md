# RMweb

My public website, however it will slowly become more generic for use by anyone.
At the moment it's probably too personalised.

Contains:

*   Projects
*   Blogging
*   Links
*   and hopes to knit the three together tightly (project's blogs for example).

Built with:

*   Flask
*   Twitter Bootstrap
*   SQLAlchemy
*   Python-Markdown
